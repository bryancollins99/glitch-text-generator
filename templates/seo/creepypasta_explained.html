<p>
  Creepypasta is a term for horror-related legends or images that have been copied and pasted around the internet. These digital urban legends have become a significant part of internet culture, creating a new form of collaborative storytelling and digital folklore.
</p>

<div class="creepy-example">
  "The last man on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door..."
</div>

<h2 id="what-is-creepypasta">What is Creepypasta?</h2>

<p>
  The term "creepypasta" comes from the internet slang "copypasta," which refers to text that has been copied and pasted multiple times across different sites. "Creepypasta" specifically refers to horror stories or legends shared this way.
</p>

<p>
  These digital horror stories range from brief, unsettling paragraphs to elaborate narratives spanning multiple posts or even websites. They often blend elements of urban legends, paranormal encounters, psychological horror, and technological fears to create uniquely internet-native horror experiences.
</p>

<div class="quote-box">
  "Creepypasta represents the evolution of oral folklore traditions in the digital age. Instead of stories being passed around campfires, they're shared through forums, social media, and dedicated websites."

<h2 id="history-of-creepypasta">The History and Evolution of Creepypasta</h2>

<p>
  Creepypasta emerged in the early 2000s as internet culture began to develop its own traditions and forms of expression. What started as simple copy-and-pasted ghost stories has evolved into a complex ecosystem of horror content creation.

<h2 id="famous-creepypastas">Famous Creepypasta Stories</h2>

<p>
  Some creepypastas have achieved legendary status in internet culture, becoming widely recognized even outside horror communities:
</p>

<div class="famous-creepypasta">
  <div class="creepypasta-title">Slender Man</div>
  <div class="creepypasta-origin">Origin: Created by Eric Knudsen (aka "Victor Surge") in 2009 for a Something Awful forum contest</div>
  <div class="creepypasta-summary">
    <p>Slender Man is depicted as an unnaturally tall, thin figure wearing a black suit with a blank, featureless face. He is said to stalk, abduct, or traumatize people, particularly children. The character was created as part of a Photoshop contest to create paranormal images.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="creepypasta-impact">
    <p>Slender Man became one of the most recognizable internet horror icons, inspiring numerous games, films, and derivative works. The character gained mainstream notoriety following a 2014 stabbing incident where two young girls attacked a classmate, claiming to do so to appease Slender Man.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="famous-creepypasta">
  <div class="creepypasta-title">Candle Cove</div>
  <div class="creepypasta-origin">Origin: Written by Kris Straub in 2009</div>
  <div class="creepypasta-summary">
    <p>Presented as a forum discussion between adults reminiscing about a disturbing children's TV show from their youth called "Candle Cove." As they share increasingly unsettling memories of the show, the story culminates in the revelation that the show never existed—children were actually watching static on a dead channel.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="creepypasta-impact">
    <p>Candle Cove is considered one of the most influential creepypastas, praised for its unique format and psychological horror. It was later adapted as the first season of the SyFy channel series "Channel Zero."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="famous-creepypasta">
  <div class="creepypasta-title">The Russian Sleep Experiment</div>
  <div class="creepypasta-origin">Origin: Anonymous, circa 2010</div>
  <div class="creepypasta-summary">
    <p>The story describes a fictional Soviet experiment in which five political prisoners were kept awake for 15 days using an experimental gas. As the experiment progresses, the subjects exhibit increasingly disturbing behavior, mutilating themselves and displaying superhuman strength and resilience.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="creepypasta-impact">
    <p>Despite being completely fictional, this story is often mistaken for a real historical event. Its visceral body horror and psychological elements have made it one of the most enduring and frequently shared creepypastas.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2 id="creepypasta-and-zalgo">Creepypasta and Zalgo Text: A Special Connection</h2>

<p>
  Zalgo text and creepypasta have a special relationship in internet horror culture. Zalgo text is often used in creepypasta stories to represent corruption, madness, or supernatural influence.
</p>

<div class="zalgo-example">
  H̸̢̧̛̭̣̖̙̙̞̩̖̰̓̈́̀̓̓̈́̌̈́͘͝ͅE̸̢̡̛̱̰̯̱̣̞̙͖̠̓̈́̀̓̓̈́̌̈́͘͝ ̸̢̧̛̭̣̖̙̙̞̩̖̰̓̈́̀̓̓̈́̌̈́͘͝ͅC̸̢̡̛̱̰̯̱̣̞̙͖̠̓̈́̀̓̓̈́̌̈́͘͝Ơ̸̢̧̭̣̖̙̙̞̩̖̰̓̈́̀̓̓̈́̌̈́͘͝ͅM̸̢̡̛̱̰̯̱̣̞̙͖̠̓̈́̀̓̓̈́̌̈́͘͝Ḙ̸̢̧̛̣̖̙̙̞̩̖̰̓̈́̀̓̓̈́̌̈́͘͝ͅS̸̢̡̛̱̰̯̱̣̞̙͖̠̓̈́̀̓̓̈́̌̈́͘͝
</div>

<p>
  The distorted, corrupted appearance of Zalgo text visually reinforces the themes of cosmic horror, reality distortion, and madness that are common in many creepypasta stories. The character of Zalgo itself, a reality-corrupting entity, has become a recurring figure in creepypasta lore.
</p>

<p>
  When creators want to indicate that a character in their story is experiencing something beyond human comprehension or is being influenced by supernatural forces, Zalgo text provides a powerful visual representation of this corruption.

</p>

<ul>
