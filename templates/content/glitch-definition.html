    <h2>What is a Glitch? Technical Definition & Origins</h2>
    
    <p>A <strong>glitch</strong> fundamentally refers to a temporary malfunction or irregularity in a system, particularly in electronic or digital contexts. The term originated in the 1960s among electronics technicians and NASA engineers, describing brief electrical pulses or voltage spikes that cause temporary system disruptions.</p>
    
    <p>In technical terms, glitches represent unintended system behaviors that occur when:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hardware components operate outside specified parameters</li>
        <li>Software encounters unexpected data or conditions</li>
        <li>Signal transmission experiences interference or corruption</li>
        <li>Memory systems fail to maintain data integrity</li>
        <li>Processing units receive conflicting instructions</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Unlike permanent failures, glitches are typically transient - they occur momentarily then resolve, often without lasting damage to the system. This temporary nature makes them particularly interesting from both technical and artistic perspectives.</p>
